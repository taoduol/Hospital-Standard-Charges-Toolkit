# Hospital-Standard-Charges-Toolkit
Reproducible tool for researchers to download and manage machine-readable hospital standard charges. Designed for data integrity and research transparency.

## 📖 Why This Tool Exists

Payer-specific prescription drug prices are frequently examined in health services and policy research. However, obtaining these prices typically requires:

- **Manual extraction** from hospital billing websites
- **Variable data formats** (each hospital structures data differently)
- **Time-consuming collection** when researching multiple hospitals
- **Complex cleaning procedures** due to data inconsistencies

This creates an organizational and documentation challenge: researchers spend hours downloading and organizing files, with limited ability to reproduce or verify their data sources.

**This tool solves that problem** by:
- Creating a reproducible, documented download process
- Maintaining an audit trail (date, source, format)
- Automatically converting formats (JSON → CSV)
- Organizing files in a shareable structure

## 🎯 What This Tool Does
✓ Downloads billing files from hospitals reproducibly  
✓ Creates audit trail (source URL, download date, file metadata)  
✓ Organizes files by hospital + date  
✓ Auto-converts formats (.ashx, .json → .csv)  
✓ Documents hospitals' billing pages (so you can verify links)
